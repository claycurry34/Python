We are the general computer science club with the core purpose to promote diversity, scholarship, mentorship, and professional development in computer science

Our chapter focuses primarily on being an inclusive, productive, supportive, and entertaining space for all students interested in computer science. At each meeting, new participants are brought up to date with current events, and eligible members vote on how to pull together resources to advance the goals and visibility of the chapter to all students on campus. In the 2020 fall semester, our officers devoted much time to hosting workshops on crucial skills for securing jobs and achieving academic success in computer science. Recently, we have been making plans to bring together interested underclassmen to help upperclassmen and faculty to build a chapter website hosted on our own server. We have also recently voted to appoint one of our members to the inagural position, Professional Development Officer. We are currently searching for a (hopefully underclassman) student who will be interested in being a social media officer.

To maximize our outreach in the next academic year, we are requesting funds to acquire promotional banners for our organization. To increase the scope of future workshops, we are requesting funds to permenantly supply our chapter with reusable programmable circuit boards. To increase member participation, we aim to provide food at every third meeting.

Officers also use these weekly meetings to handle business required by our national organization (annual reports, officer elections, etc). To increase member participation,  we aim to provide food at every third meeting. 

With twenty-four meetings per academic year, we will allocate food at a total of eight meetings in the 2021-2022 academic year, budgeting approximately $35 per meeting.

((24 meetings) / 3 ) * $35.00 = $280

Until four years ago, the University of Oklahoma's Chapter of SACM served primarily as the organizing body for the annual Hacklahoma. When Hacklahoma moved to become a private entity, the leaders of SACM devoted much less time to maintaining continuity of the Chapter, which, for all practical purposes, dissolved as a registered student organization. However, in recent semesters, SACM has seen a revival by numerous undergraduate and graduate students who have noticed a need for a year-round technical organization for students interested in computer science.

All chapter-related documentation, meeting minutes, and old paperwork are digitally contained and available to all members on our online GitHub repository. We do not use paper when unnessessary. The requested programmable circuit boards in this budget proposal are intended to last for many years of workshops. For food related events, we will be in contact with Facilities Management to assist with providing recycling bins.
